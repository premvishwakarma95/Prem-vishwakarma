        Hi, I&apos;m Prem Vishwakarma, a passionate Full-Stack Developer specializing in the MERN stack with production experience using Next.js, TypeScript, and modern web tooling. I love crafting intuitive, high-performance web applications that solve real-world problems with clean, scalable code.

      <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 md:text-lg mb-4">
        My expertise spans across both frontend and backend, with a focus on building seamless user experiences using React, Redux Toolkit, Context API, and Tailwind CSS. On the backend, I work with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, using Mongoose to manage complex data structures.

      <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 md:text-lg mb-4">
        I&apos;ve integrated secure and reliable payment systems including Stripe, PayPal, and Authorize.net, and visualized analytics through Chart.js to make data more meaningful and actionable.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 md:text-lg mb-4">
        I&apos;m comfortable working in agile teams, writing reusable components, implementing REST APIs, and deploying full-stack apps to platforms like Vercel, CloudPanel. I also regularly use tools like Postman, GitHub, and Figma to streamline development and collaboration.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 md:text-lg mb-4">
        I&apos;m continuously learning and love exploring new tech that helps me deliver better results. Whether it&apos;s enhancing UI/UX or optimizing performance, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what&apos;s possible on the web.
